JavaScript / HTML / CSS / Agile / Adobe Photoshop / Bootstrap 

A front end web applciation for a pizza ordering system. To see the final draft and main focus of the project open the order.html file. This is a group project created in my Human Computer Interaction course. 

### Building Process
The SDLC method used was the agile method

1. Basic requirements for what a pizza ordering system should have was established 
2. Hand drawn skteches were created based on the requirements 
3. The sketches were evaluated by users. 
    * Users were evaluated by asking questions such as which do you find more aesthitically pleasing? Which sketch do you like the most andy why? Which sketch did you like the least and why? 
4. Based on the results of the sketches. Hard coded prototype web pages were created to show the users overall design.
5. Again, users evaluated the webpage.
